# Synter for Amp

Synter connects Amp to your ad accounts for performance reports and approved changes across 43 ad platforms through the hosted MCP server at https://mcp.synterai.com.

- Reads are free. Writes cost $0.25 per verified write, 0% of ad spend.
- Changes that spend money are shown for approval before they run.
- First use opens a browser sign-in (OAuth). In orbs, see the orbs starter instead.

## Good first prompts
- "List my connected ad accounts."
- "Show spend, conversions and CPA by platform for the last 7 days."
- "Which campaigns lost the most efficiency this week, and why?"
- "Draft a budget shift from the worst to the best campaign and wait for my approval."

## Rules for the agent
- Start with read tools. Show the plan for any write and get explicit approval first.
- If a tool says a connection expired, tell the user which platform to reconnect.
